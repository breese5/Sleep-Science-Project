### Project Plan: Public Sleep Science Explainer Bot

#### **Project Overview**
The Public Sleep Science Explainer Bot is a conversational AI designed to interpret, summarize, and explain publicly available sleep-related academic papers, clinical guidelines, and trusted news articles. It provides layperson-friendly explanations and helps users quickly grasp key insights about sleep, health, and longevity research.
